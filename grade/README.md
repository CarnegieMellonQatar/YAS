###### proposal  10/10

The main feature is clearly the storytelling editor/reader. The data analytics and the collaboration seem to be additional features.

The WebRTC collaboration feature seems very artificial and does not deserve directly the main goal of the app.

To do data analytics, you need data. Since you are in an early phase of development, you will not get much data by the time you demo the project. Therefore, I doubt you will need/be-able to use analytics API such as Keen.io.

The project in itself does not seem very substantial. The quality of your app could make a difference, make sure to do it well.
