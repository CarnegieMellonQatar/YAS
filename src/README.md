# Source Code

Install Django MPTT: 
	pip install django-mptt

	pip install django-mptt-admin (look at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-mptt-admin/ and https://github.com/mbraak/django-mptt-admin)

What works in the beta is the D3 editor of the stories. However the peer to peer system is poor as the code structure failed to be flexible enough for handling multiple peers. However we are looking to make it more flexible in the future. 2 of the features that were promised were delivered in this version.

To run this, go to the resources folder, find the bower install and run 
	bower install

Then run two browsers (two tabs) and click on create session in one of them and then click on join session in another. You will see the same tree in both of them. It is not real time yet.
