4. Notes:
---------
- In order to achieve the desired results from the analytics part of the project, we needed data to analyze. We wrote python functions to populate the database with random trees. If you look at the last 2 URLs in the api URLs, you will know how we populated the database. Note that these API calls were removed from the file when we deployed the application for the final version. In this submission we have left them there just for you to know if you need to.
