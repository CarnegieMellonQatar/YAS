Real-time Collaborative Story Telling

2. Project Description
--------------------------
Dynamic story telling are stories that change based on the decisions of the readers. The format follows a typical story, however when there is a decision to be made the story asks the reader what direction would it like to go. For instance, "There were zombies inching from every crevice and we all knew that it was time to leave. I took out my gun and shot once, twice, thrice, *click* ... 'damn, my gun is empty!' I looked all around for more ammunition and all I could see was zombies, now is definitely the time to leave. But if I leave now, my gun will be empty and if I see more zombies I'll probably face major conflict. And if I stay and search for bullets I might get injured or even die. I had a decision to make: Should I stay and look for ammo, or should I leave now?". Now the reader has to make a decision. Based on that decision the story has to adapt creating a fun experience.

Stories that have multiple storylines are difficult to write and visualise. We are going to create a platform for authors to write stories that have multiple storylines through the help of their readers. To be able to explain this project fully I ask that the reader of this description to visualise a tree graph. Each parent node in the tree would represent a part of the story. Each child node would represent the story if that path were taken.

On top of that we want to have a collaborative experience. The author could choose to write the story on his own or he could turn the option to get people to join and collaborate. We want to create the platform to be collaborative and real-time. Such that the author has to create the first parent node and the rest could be created by the author or the collaborators. This will all happen real-time which means the story graph will be populated by multiple people online and that's how the story will be told.

Lastly, we want to have a data analysis aspect that tells the authors of the stories which storyline was most appealing to the readers (and collaborative writers, if any). This likeness could be visualised by changing the colors of the nodes in the graph to indicate the more popular routes, or by generating a report for the authors and even possibly the readers after finishing the segment of the story. It will be interesting for the reader to see what other people have chosen for their stories. In addition, this will help authors better understand their readers and what they like the most. 

This will be achieved by the following libraries. 
1) d3.js - To achieve the visualisation of the graph. https://d3js.org/
2) WebRTC - To achieve p2p collaborative support from different people. https://webrtc.org/
3) Keen.io - To achieve data analysis of different storylines (not very certain yet). https://keen.io/product/
